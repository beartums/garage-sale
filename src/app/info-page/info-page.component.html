<h2>About our Online Garage Sale</h2>>
<p>Looks like we are actually leaving this time.  We're planning to be back in the states by the end of the 
  first week of August.  But - boy! - do we have a lot of stuff.  After almost 5 years of dragging back bag after bag of 
  goodies from our visits home and beautifying our home with locally made furniture, we have to get rid of all of it.  
  And that redounds to your benefit.
</p>
<p>Everything will be for sale online until it is sold or the week of June 29, when we will probably have an IRL, actual, 
  real garage sale.  There will be a lot of stuff there that you will not see on the site, because we just can't 
  post it all.  So make sure you keep your eye out for that.  If you do happen to want something on the site, you can always
  contact us by clickng on the email icon at the top of the item and letting us know.  Or contact us by Whatsapp, Phone, email,
  Facebook, or any other contact information you have for us.
</p>
<p>We came up with prices based on our original costs, how much effort went into it, how much we're going to miss it, 
  and what we think it's worth.  So, for the moment, the prices are firm.  But if you want to make an offer, please do!
  We'll hold onto it until either the time is sold or we're leaving.  If it's still around and your offer was the highest,
  it's all yours!
